# Library for pure C++ helpers

The toolbox is a library with various tools to make C++ coding easier.
For example string operations like in python, coloured std output, progress
monitors, vector, timing and memory tools. This is partially used
in [Artus](https://github.com/artus-analysis/Artus).
This library is compiled with -pedantic.
